# Fridge

I created this project to demonstrate my coding style and some of the skills I've developed. My goal was to build something that touches on key aspects of full-stack development, like databases, frontend and backend, authentication, role-based systems, testing, and more.

The project is a family reminders app, named **"Fridge"**, inspired by the sticky notes commonly found on a family kitchen fridge! üòÅ

I aimed to demonstrate the complete application lifecycle, focusing on the developer workflow ‚Äî coding to testing and deployment. The stack I chose reflects these aspects and showcases the technologies I am most comfortable with.

## How to Use: Try It Out

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

To spin up the stack run:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost

- Backend API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

- Backend API Base URL: http://localhost:8000/api -> Health check: http://localhost:8000/api/ping/

## Development

For development, you need to start the development database. To do so, run the following script:

```bash
bash scripts/start-dev-db.sh
```

The script will spin up the Docker container for the development database and set it up using the `scripts/setup-db.sh` script in the `backend/` directory.

It will check if the development database is running, apply the necessary migrations, and initialize the database with the initial data.

### The .env file

The `.env` file is the one that contains all your configurations, generated keys and passwords, etc.

Depending on your workflow, you could want to exclude it from Git, for example if your project is public. In that case, you would have to make sure to set up a way for your CI tools to obtain it while building or deploying your project.

One way to do it could be to add each environment variable to your CI/CD system, and updating the `docker-compose.yml` file to read that specific env var instead of reading the `.env` file.

### Pre-commits and code linting

we are using a tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for code linting and formatting.

When you install it, it runs right before making a commit in git. This way it ensures that the code is consistent and formatted even before it is committed.

You can find a file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with configurations at the root of the project.

#### Install pre-commit to run automatically

`pre-commit` is already part of the dependencies of the project, but you could also install it globally if you prefer to, following [the official pre-commit docs](https://pre-commit.com/).

After having the `pre-commit` tool installed and available, you need to "install" it in the local repository, so that it runs automatically before each commit.

Using `poetry`, you could do it with:

```bash
‚ùØ poetry run pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now whenever you try to commit, e.g. with:

```bash
git commit
```

...pre-commit will run and check and format the code you are about to commit, and will ask you to add that code (stage it) with git again before committing.

Then you can `git add` the modified/fixed files again and now you can commit.

#### Running pre-commit hooks manually

you can also run `pre-commit` manually on all the files, you can do it using `poetry` with:

```bash
‚ùØ poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
check for added large files..............................................Passed
check toml...............................................................Passed
check yaml...............................................................Passed
ruff.....................................................................Passed
ruff-format..............................................................Passed
eslint...................................................................Passed
prettier.................................................................Passed
```

## Backend Development

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python package and environment management.

From `backend/` you can install all the dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install
```

Now run the fastapi development server:

```bash
poetry run fastapi dev app/main.py
```

### Migrations

You can run the migrations with `alembic`.

Make sure you create a `"revision"` of your models and that you `"upgrade"` your database with that revision every time you change them. As this is what will update the tables in your database. Otherwise, your application will have errors.

Alembic is already configured to import your SQLModel models from ./backend/app/models.py.

After changing a model (for example, adding a column), create a revision, e.g.:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add column last_name to User model"
```

Commit to the git repository the files generated in the alembic directory.

After creating the revision, run the migration in the database (this is what will actually change the database):

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Backend testing

To test the backend run:

```bash
poetry run bash scripts/test.sh
```

The tests run with Pytest, modify and add tests to `backend/tests/`.


Backend docs: [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md).

## Frontend development

Before you begin, ensure that you have either the Node Version Manager (nvm) or Fast Node Manager (fnm) installed on your system.

* To install fnm follow the [official fnm guide](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#installation). If you prefer nvm, you can install it using the [official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

* After installing either nvm or fnm, proceed to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```
* If the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file isn't installed on your system, you can install it using the appropriate command:

```bash
# If using fnm
fnm install

# If using nvm
nvm install
```

* Once the installation is complete, switch to the installed version:

```bash
# If using fnm
fnm use

# If using nvm
nvm use
```

* Within the `frontend` directory, install the necessary NPM packages:

```bash
npm install
```

* And start the live server with the following `npm` script:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Then open your browser at http://localhost:5173/.

### Generate Client

#### Automatically

* From the top level project directory, run the script:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-client.sh
```

* Commit the changes.

#### Manually

* Start the backend server.

* Download the OpenAPI JSON file from `http://localhost:8000/api/openapi.json` and copy it to `openapi.json` at the root of the `frontend` directory.


* To generate the frontend client, run:

```bash
npm run generate-client
```

* Commit the changes.

Notice that every time the backend changes (changing the OpenAPI schema), you should follow these steps again to update the frontend client.

### Frontend testing with Playwright

The frontend includes initial end-to-end tests using Playwright. To run the tests, you need to have the development database running. Start the db with the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/start-dev-db.sh
```

Then, you can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

To update the tests, navigate to the tests directory and modify the existing test files or add new ones as needed.

For more information on writing and running Playwright tests, refer to the official [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
